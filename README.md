Here you can find all the information with reference to this new club and offers that we have for subscribers, as well as you can access the store to be able to acquire your necessary chess material to train and be able to participate in tournaments.

# Features

The website contains a home page with four sections and links are to the right: About Us, Schedule, Shop and Contact Us, which link to different sections of the same page; only the shop opens on a different page (I used the page of a chess store that we have in Mexico just to use an example of how it would be)


# Design
The design for this project came from ”Love Running” project, and the idea comes from the fact that I want to open a chess club here with its store of products since in Mexico we manufacture and sell and we see great potential here, as I was carrying out the "Love running" project, the desire to start it grew here.
